CS1015 Fall Project - Teletutor
Pitch: Teletutor 

Group Name: Time Machine

Slogan: Better Help, Better Study 

1. Problem
Sometimes it’s like 11:52 p.m. and you have one question left on your assignment that you just do not understand. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could call someone up to explain the answer to you right away? Students often face last-minute confusion and lack of access to quick, reliable academic help, especially when time is running out without anyone there to provide immediate assistance for last minute problems.

2. Solution
Teletutor is the solution. The idea is to combine the open, community-style help of platforms like Reddit with the immediacy and reliability of professional tutoring where users can have access to real tutors in real time. Users can post questions and wait for a community answer for free, or choose to subscribe for instant professional assistance through on-call tutors there to help at a minute's notice.
In a world where AI tools are becoming mainstream, this disconnects us from having access to real-life help from actual people who can explain, guide, and teach in the moment. That’s where Teletutor comes in; users are granted the ability to connect with tutors who can understand and relate to their struggles while offering more: including study tips, personal mnemonics that helped them along the way, and encouragement to provide more than simply a structured response
There could even be a tiered model, allowing users to pay more for broader access across different subjects or specialized tutors. That way, the next time you have an assignment due and AI tools like ChatGPT aren’t making sense, you can call on Teletutor for better help and better study.

3. Monetize
A monthly subscription provides access to a professional hotline in any subject, ensuring immediate, quality help whenever it’s needed.

Teletutor will generate cash flow through a subscription-based model, offering several tiers of service.

Free tier: Community-based question board.
Standard subscription: Monthly fee for access to professional tutors in one subject area.
Premium tier: Higher monthly fee for access to multiple subjects and priority response times.
Ads: Built-in ads visible to users to generate additional revenue through sponsorships.

This model creates a scalable and sustainable source of income while offering students flexibility in choosing the level of support they need
