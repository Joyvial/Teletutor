                <td>Add 12 to both sides to get 5x = 15, then divide by 5. So x = 3.</td>

                <td>
                    An equation has an equal sign and can be solved.
                    An expression has no equal sign and cannot be “solved,” only simplified.

                <td>
                    Plug in –x. If f(–x) = f(x), it’s even. If f(–x) = –f(x), it’s odd.

                <td>
                    It is the instantaneous rate of change — like the speed shown on a speedometer at one moment.

                <td>
                    Use trig substitution when you see square roots like √(a² − x²), √(a² + x²), or √(x² − a²).

                <td>Why do we use series expansions?</td>
                <td>
                    Series let us approximate complicated functions using polynomials that are easier to work with.

                <td>
                    It measures how the function changes with respect to one variable while keeping the others fixed.

                <td>
                    A level curve is a set of points where the function has the same value, like contour lines on a map.
